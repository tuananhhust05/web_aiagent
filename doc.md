FORSKALE MULTI-CHANNEL WORKFLOW


Business Operational Document → IT



INTRODUCTION: THE FOUNDATION
PLATFORM NEUROSCIENTIFIC

Before entering the operational logic of workflows, it is essential to understand the foundation that makes ForSkale unique: the neuroscientific RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

What it is and why it is strategic
Neuroscientific RAG is an artificial intelligence system that combines:

Principles of neuroscience applied to commercial communication
Scientifically validated neuromarketing models
Behavioral patterns that maximize engagement and conversion
This system guides every message, every timing, every touchpoint of the platform, ensuring that automations are not simple mechanical sequences, but psychologically optimized interactions.

Concrete impact
Scientific studies show that applying neuroscientific principles to sales increases conversion rates by 40-60% (Journal of Consumer Psychology, 2023). ForSkale's RAG integrates these principles into automation, making scalable results that previously depended only on the individual expertise of the best salespeople.
In summary: the neuroscientific RAG is the "brain" of the platform, which transforms data and behaviors into scientifically effective commercial actions.

TRIGGER SYSTEM - THE ENGINE OF AUTOMATION


Why the Trigger Function is Crucial


The Trigger as the starting point of every automation

Triggers represent the nervous system of the ForSkale platform. Each automated action begins with a carefully defined trigger that determines when, how and why a workflow should activate.
The quality and precision of the triggers directly influence the effectiveness of the entire commercial automation: a poorly configured trigger can generate irrelevant or sent communications at the wrong time, drastically reducing conversion rates.

Impact on the relevance and timing of actions

A well-configured trigger ensures that each communication arrives at the optimal time in the customer journey. The system analyses:
Behaviors (email openings, clicks, site visits)
Timing patterns (times of greatest engagement)
Context signals (funnel stage, lead score, previous interactions)

This ensures that actions are activated when the probability of engagement is maximum, avoiding premature communications (which waste opportunities) or late communications (which miss the moment of interest).

Correlation between trigger quality and conversion rate

Industry studies show a direct correlation of 73% between trigger accuracy and final conversion rate:
Generic triggers → conversion rate 2-4%
Optimized triggers → conversion rate 12-18%

Functional Note for IT
Each trigger must be configurable by the user through a dedicated interface, defining:
Trigger type (event, condition, storm)
Activation condition (numerical thresholds, specific actions, time intervals)
Workflow to start when the trigger fires
The behavior of the system when a trigger fires:
• Automatically launch the linked workflow
• Record the event in database for future analysis and optimization
• Feeds KPI dashboard for performance monitoring
• Enable A/B testing on the same trigger for continuous optimization

A/B Testing function in Triggers


What is A/B Testing

A/B testing is a scientific methodology that simultaneously compares two variations (A and B) of an action to identify which produces superior results.
In the context of ForSkale triggers, each decision point can be tested to scientifically optimize the engagement sequence.

Why A/B Testing is essential for Sales and Marketing

A/B testing transforms sales from a subjective action to a measurable science:

Scientific optimization: Eliminate guesswork and personal bias
Risk Reduction: Prevent costly decisions based on unvalidated insights
Continuous improvement: Every interaction generates data to refine the system
Measurable ROI: Quantify the economic impact of each change

Practical example of A/B Test on Trigger

Scenario: Test on timing of second follow-up after unanswered email

Variant
Timing
Response Rate
Variant A
2 days later first email
12%
Variant B
5 days later first email
18%

Algorithmic decision: The system automatically suggests Variant B in the future and asks if the user wants to make the change in the reference model

The machine learning process:

Test: Two variants are tested (probably with different timing for the second follow-up after an unanswered email)
Measurement: Variant B demonstrates a 50% higher response rate than Variant A (18% vs 12%)
Automatic application: The system autonomously recognizes the winning variant and automatically applies it to all future workflows of the same type
Competitive advantage:

This approach eliminates the need for manual analysis and human decisions for optimization, allowing the system to continuously improve performance in an autonomous and data-driven way, making workflows increasingly effective over time.




Data Tracking A/B Test

The ForSkale system implements a comprehensive tracking framework to ensure continuous, scientific optimization:

Dashboard visualization

Results available in real-time with statistical confidence intervals to validate the significance of the results before applying definitive changes.

Metrics tracked

Metric
Description
Impression
Number of times the trigger was fired
Click-through rate (CTR)
Percentage of users who clicked on links/CTAs after trigger activation
Response rate
Percentage of users who responded to the communication generated by the trigger
Conversion rate
Percentage of users who completed the target action (e.g. meeting booked, purchase completed)




Metric
Description
Weighted revenue attribution
Attribution of the economic value generated by each tested trigger variant


Statistical significance

The results are considered conclusive only after reaching a minimum statistical significance threshold (typically 95% confidence level), avoiding premature decisions based on insufficient samples.

Historical archive

Complete database of all tests conducted, results obtained and decisions applied. This archive feeds:
Machine learning for future predictions
Benchmarks for new campaigns
Company knowledge base on validated best practices



Concluding Note: The trigger system combined with continuous A/B testing transforms ForSkale from a simple automation platform to an evolutionary artificial intelligence system that autonomously improves commercial performance over time, adapting to the real behavior of prospects and customers.


WORKFLOW 
HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM


The ForSkale system organizes workflows according to a multi-level hierarchical structure accessible from the Dashboard, ensuring intuitive navigation and efficient management of sales and customer success activities.

The Levels of the Hierarchy

LEVEL 0: B2B/B2C/B2B2C CATEGORIZATION (Level
Platform)

Before operational navigation, the ForSkale system categorizes workflows and models based on the client company's business model.
Categories Business Models

Category
Description
Workflow examples
B2B
Business-to-Business: Enterprise sales with long cycles and complex decision-making
Multi-stakeholder lead qualification, Enterprise sales campaigns, Account-based marketing
B2C
Business-to-Consumer: direct sales to the consumer with individual decision-making
E-commerce conversion, Retail customer retention, Direct-to-consumer upsell
B2B2C
Business-to-Business-to-Consumer: Sales through partners serving end-consumers
Partner enablement, Channel marketing, Indirect sales support

Important note: Client companies only see models relevant to their business model. For example, a B2B company will see B2B models, but not B2C and B2B2C.

Roles and Responsibilities in Categorization

Super Admin (ForSkale Platform)

Super Admins represent the highest level of governance of the ForSkale platform and have key strategic responsibilities.

Creation of the Basic Hierarchical Structure

Super Admins are solely responsible for creating and managing the entire platform architecture:
LEVEL 0: They create and define business model categories (B2B, B2C, B2B2C)
LEVEL 1: They define the funnel management sections (Dashboard, Conversion Activities, CSM, Renewals, Up/Cross Sell, etc.)
LEVEL 2: They create the macro sections for strategic objective (Lead Generation, Lead Qualification, Closing, Onboarding, etc.)
LEVEL 3: They define the specific goal subcategories (Book a Meeting, BANT Scoring, Free Trial Conversion, etc.)
This hierarchical structure is fixed and standardized to ensure consistency and shared best practices among all client companies.

Creation and Categorization of Global Model Workflows

Super Admins develop basic template workflows that represent universal best practices in sales and customer success. For each template workflow you create, they must:
Design the workflow:

Define the sequence of touchpoints (email, LinkedIn, AI calls, WhatsApp, etc.)
Configure conditional triggers based on prospect behaviors
Establish optimal timing between actions
Integrating neuroscientific principles of persuasion
Configure measurement KPIs

Categorize the workflow (MANDATORY):

During creation, the Super Admin must assign the workflow to one or more business model categories.

Workflow Categorization Examples
Workflow Model
Categorization
Motivation
Enterprise Multi-stakeholder Meeting Request
B2B
Long sales cycle, multiple decision makers






Workflow Model
Categorization
Motivation
E-commerce Abandoned Cart Recovery
B2C
Individual purchase decision, short cycle
Partner Enablement Onboarding
B2B2C
Sales through indirect channel
Free Trial to Paid Conversion
B2B
B2C
Applicable to both models with customizations
Account Expansion Cross-sell
B2B
B2B2C
Enterprise and partner account expansion

Important note: A workflow can be assigned to multiple categories when its logic is applicable to multiple business models.
Document the workflow:

Create clear and concise description
Specify ideal use cases
Document expected KPIs (benchmarks)
Include personalization best practices

Quality Management and Governance

Super Admins maintain the overall governance of the platform:

Scientific validation: Ensure that workflows integrate validated neuroscientific principles
Continuously updated: They analyze aggregate data from all companies to identify opportunities for improvement
Compliance standards: They guarantee legal and regulatory compliance (GDPR, CAN-SPAM, etc.)
Performance monitoring: Monitor the aggregate performance of global workflows

Innovation and Development

Super Admins guide the evolution of the platform:

They develop new model workflows based on emerging trends

They integrate new features (e.g. new communication channels, new AI capabilities)
They conduct large-scale A/B tests to validate innovations
They publish updates and new versions of existing workflows




Admin Client Companies

The Admins of ForSkale client companies operate at a different level, focusing on customization and business management.

Responsibility:

Access to relevant workflows:

They only see global model workflows categorized by their business model
Example: A B2B company sees B2B and B2B2C workflows, but does NOT see B2C workflows
Customization and creation of business models:

LEVEL 3: Goal Subcategory Management

Company Admins can:

Add new custom goal subcategories:

Create goal subcategories specific to your organization's needs
The new subcategories are added within the existing macro sections (LEVEL 2)
Example: Inside the "Closing" macro section, the Admin can add "Technical Demo Scheduling"
Manage the visibility of ForSkale global goal subcategories:

They CANNOT delete goal subcategories created by Super Admins (protected structure)
They can obscure irrelevant global goal subcategories via On/Off flags
Redacted subcategories are not seen by your company's operational users

The darkening is reversible

Visibility Management Example

Macro Section: Closing (Conversion Activities)
ForSkale Global Goals Subcategories:
Book a Meeting
[ON] Visible


Free Trial to Paid Conversion
[ON] Visible

The workflow must be supervised and approved by the company manager (Admin)
The manager evaluates: policy compliance, messaging quality, best practice alignment, compliance
Once approved, the workflow can be executed
If excellent performance, it can be promoted to business model

Complete Autonomy (Optional - On Request):

They require permission from the manager to be free to create workflows without supervision
The manager evaluates: experience, track record, knowledge of best practices
If authorized, they can create and launch workflows independently
The manager maintains visibility for post-activation audits

Special Case: Free Trial (14 days):

Duration: 14 day free trial

STEP 1: Super Admin ForSkale

Workflow design:

Touchpoint 1: Personalized Email (Day 1)
Touchpoint 2: LinkedIn connection request + message (day 3, if email opened)
Touchpoint 3: AI Voice Call (day 5, if no response)
Touchpoint 4: WhatsApp reminder (day 7, if interest shown)

Categorization (MANDATORY):
B2B - Workflow optimized for enterprise sales cycles
B2B2C - Also applicable to partners selling to enterprise
B2C - NOT applicable to consumer direct sales


Documentation:

Name: "Enterprise Multi-touch Meeting Request"
Description: "Multi-channel sequential workflow to book meetings with enterprise decision makers"
KPI benchmark: 18% conversion rate, 45% email open rate
Use cases: Cold outreach enterprise, warm lead follow-up

Publication: The workflow becomes available to all B2B and B2B2C companies

PHASE 2: Client Company Admin (SaaS B2B)

Access: View "Enterprise Multi-touch Meeting Request" in the "Book a Meeting" subcategory
Customization: Duplicate the global workflow, modify the message for the SaaS sector, add video demos
Approval: Makes the new model visible to operational users

PHASE 3: Operational User (Sales Rep)

Selection: Access "Book a Meeting" and see available templates
Instance creation: Select the business model, create instance for prospect list
Execution: Launch campaign, monitor results, optimize




NOTE to the IT Department: Visibility Flag System

Flag Visibility Subcategories Goals (LEVEL 3)
goal_category_visibility:
book_a_meeting: is_global = true, visible = true, created_by = "super_admin"
free_trial_to_paid: is_global = true, visible = true, created_by = "super_admin"
proposal_followup: is_global = true, visible = false (Hidden by Admin), created_by = "super_admin"
technical_demo_scheduling: is_global = false, visible = true, created_by = "admin_company_123"

Behavior:
Global subcategories: visible: true/false (Admin can obscure but not delete)
Custom subcategories: visible: true/false (Admin can create, edit, obscure, delete)
Security: Subcategories with is_global: true cannot be deleted by Company Admin


Model Workflow Visibility Flag
workflow_model_visibility:
enterprise_multitouch_meeting: workflow_id = "wf_global_001", is_global = true, visible = true
quick_connect_hot_leads: workflow_id = "wf_global_002", is_global = true, visible = false (Obscured)
saas_enterprise_meeting: workflow_id = "wf_company_123_001", is_global = false, visible = true, based_on = "wf_global_001"
custom_demo_request: workflow_id = "wf_company_123_002", is_global = false, visible = true, based_on = null


Cascade Visibility Logic

Important rule: The visibility of workflows depends on the visibility of the goal subcategory that contains them.

If Goal Subcategory = OFF (Obscured):
→ ALL contained workflows (global and enterprise) are hidden from operational users
If Goal Subcategory = ON (Visible):
→ Global Workflows with flag ON: Visible to operational users
→ Global Workflows with OFF flag: Hidden from operational users
→ Business Workflows with flag ON: Visible to operational users
→ Business Workflows with OFF flag: Hidden from operational users

ENDLESS WORKFLOW


Definition and Concept

Endless Workflows represent continuous automations without a pre-established end, designed to cyclically contact dormant leads with a progressive and intelligent approach. Unlike traditional workflows with a fixed sequence and a defined deadline, these workflows do not have an end date but continually evolve based on the behaviors and responses of prospects.
KEY FEATURES: Endless Workflows maintain contact with qualified prospects for indefinite periods, adapting strategy, content and frequency based on the engagement signals received.


Strategic rationale

The need for Endless Workflows arises from a documented reality of the sales market:
Market statistics: 60% of sales occur after the fifth contact with the prospect
Behavioral problem: 80% of sales representatives stop on the second contact attempt
Opportunity gap: There is enormous untapped potential in systematic follow-ups over the long term
Technology Solution: Intelligent automation can manage touchpoints over the long term without increasing marginal costs
This gap represents a strategic opportunity: while most companies abandon qualified prospects after a few attempts, Endless Workflows continue to nurture these relationships until conversion or final exclusion.
Dynamic Evolution of Endless Workflows

Progression-Based Evolution
The workflow dynamically adapts to the prospect's stage in the buying journey:
Awareness phase: Educational content, thought leadership, problem identification
Consideration Phase: Comparisons, case studies, proof of concept
Decision Phase: Commercial proposals, personalized demos, time incentives
The system uses behavioral signals to automatically identify the current phase and adapt the messaging and approach strategy accordingly.
Engagement-Based Evolution
The intensity and frequency of communication are based on the level of engagement demonstrated:

Livello Engagement
Strategia
Frequenza Contatti
Tipo Contenuti
Alto Engagement
Touchpoint frequenti e diretti
2-3 volte/settimana
Commerciali, demo, call-to-action
Medio Engagement
Nurturing bilanciato
1 volta/settimana
Mix educativo e commerciale
Basso Engagement
Value-driven distanziato
1 volta/2 settimane
Educational, industry insights
Dormiente
Reactivation campaigns
1 volta/mese
Re-engagement, survey, incentivi

Channel-Based Evolution
Intelligent rotation of communication channels to avoid saturation and maximize overall reach:
Email: Main starting point, detailed tracking of opens and clicks
LinkedIn: Social engagement, connection building, content sharing
WhatsApp: Personalized communications, high response rate
AI Voice Caller: Escalation with human touch, natural conversations
The system alternates channels strategically to avoid saturation on a single touchpoint and keep the prospect's interest high.
Temporal Optimization
The timing of each communication is optimized based on:
Behavioral data: Personalized best time to send for each prospect
Seasonal cycles: Respect for the prospect's periods of high and low activity
Business cycles: Alignment with the target's business decision-making cycles
Blackout periods: Automatically avoid holidays, vacations, critical periods

Neuroscientific RAG Integration
Endless Workflows integrate validated neuroscientific principles to maximize long-term persuasive effectiveness:
Reciprocity principle

Provide value before asking for something in return
Useful contents: insights, tools, exclusive reports
Create a sense of psychological obligation in the prospect

Scarcity principle
Limited time offers strategically distributed over time
Exclusivity on premium content or early access
FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) used in a controlled manner

Social Proof
Case studies progressively more relevant to the specific prospect
Testimonials from customers in similar industries or situations
Adoption data and success metrics in their market

BLACKLIST AND GDPR MANAGEMENT


Centralized Corporate Blacklist System

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is the European regulation that regulates how companies must collect, manage, store and protect people's personal data. It was created to guarantee transparency, security and control to users over how their data is used.
Being compliant with the GDPR is essential because:
avoids legal risks and very high penalties;
protects the company's reputation, demonstrating seriousness and respect for privacy;
guarantees clear and secure processes in data management;
improves customer trust and the quality of communications.

Fundamental Concept – Corporate Blacklist
 The company's blacklist system is a centralized database that records all contacts who have requested to no longer be contacted.
 Includes:
unsubscribe volunteers,
complaints or complaints,
cancellation requests according to the GDPR,
exclusions defined by internal policies.
It serves to ensure that the company respects user preferences and remains fully compliant with the GDPR.
